Why are you interested in quantum computing?

</br></br>
Quantum computing will offer the developing world of artificial intelligence more computing power, which in turn will lead to more robust AI systems that can better understand us, "think for themselves," offer more efficient machine learning and better solve small and large problems.

Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize computation by making certain types of classically intractable problems solvable. While no quantum computer is yet sophisticated enough to carry out calculations that a classical computer can't, great progress is under way

Why is quantum computing the future?

On the other hand, Quantum computing uses qubits that can be both 1 and 0 simultaneously. This allows many calculations to be done simultaneously, so quantum computing is powerful. It's also why it's seen as the future of artificial intelligence and data science

Why is quantum computing so powerful?

</br></br>
The predominant explanation of a quantum computer's advantage over a classical computer is that we can prepare quantum bits in a superposition of an exponential number of states. Then, the quantum algorithm computes all possible inputs at the same time.
